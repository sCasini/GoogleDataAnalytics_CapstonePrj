## Case study chosen

**Scenario**

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diﬀerently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But ﬁrst, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.
